A kinematic linkage is an assembly of joints connected together by approximately rigid structures called links - examples include arms, legs, and torsoes branching into multiple limbs. To restrict the design space to make it tractable to explore, we approximate link shapes as bent tubes. Depending on the context, these tubes can be the link shapes directly fabricated (as many real links are approximately tubular) or can be used as bounds within which to fine-tune shapes (e.g. with topology optimization).

My thesis work has several areas:

- Guaranteed Shape Design Algorithms: these algorithms take as input a specification of a 3D mechanism's desired kinematics (axes of motion, joint types and sizes, which joint connects to which) and outputs the 

- Joint Arrangement Optimization: 

- Interactive Human-in-the-loop Design: 

- Fabrication of Tubular Linkages:
